Description: Control your L2TP IPsec VPN connections
 This GUI is not a network manager plugin. However, it provides a system tray
 icon in the notification area from which a non privileged user can establish
 and bring down L2TP over IPsec VPN connections.
 .
 There is also a 'Edit connections' menu item. In order to bring up the 
 editor dialog, a non privileged user must authenticate as root.
 .
 From there the user can add, remove and edit vpn connections.
 .
 Editing allows configuring various options for IPsec, L2TP and PPP.
 .
 Among others, the user can configure eg. the gateway, the use of either 
 PSK or a certificate for authentication, various L2TP options as redial-
 timeout and attempts and of course all important PPP options. It also 
 allows you to configure PPP for tunnel splitting because you can add 
 routes as you want.
 .
 When applying your settings, all necessary configuration files are written
 accordingly (ipsec.conf, xl2tp.conf, options.xl2tpd, opensc.conf up and
 down scripts ...).
 .
 It relies on Openswan and xl2tp packages as the underlying protocol
 handlers.
 .
 You can also use certificates on your local machine or, if e.g. OpenSC is 
 installed and configured, even on a smart card to handle PPP
 authentication.
 .
 The GUI automatically detects when network interfaces are going up or 
 down and can (if so configured) automatically establish or close VPN
 connections.
